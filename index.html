           a short note
         <br>
         "Hi, my name is Anshu. Ansh, my online art gallery, showcases a portion of my creativity and emotions through my paintings. Each piece reflects my passion for painting and the lessons I've learned, including patience and emotional control. I hope to share the peace and hope it brings me with others through Ansh.

        <div class="aroundimg"><img src="/images/sunset.jpg" alt="sunset"></div>
        <br>
        <p>This is my second SUNSET painting and I thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating it. My favorite aspect of this piece is the beautiful pinkish color in the center, which adds a touch of warmth and serenity to the overall composition.

          <div class="aroundimg"><img src="/images/bigsun.jpg" alt="sunset"></div>
         <br>
         <p>I named this painting 'A BIG SUN' because of the big and beautiful sun in it. The lake is blue and shiny, making it look pure and peaceful. This painting makes me feel like I'm there, feeling the warm sun on my skin.</p>

        <div class="slide"><div class="aroundimg"> <img src="/images/party.jpg" alt="sunset"></div>
          <br>
        <p>This is my favorite painting. The blue sky with date trees is breathtaking and the orange ocean stands out against the black mountains. This piece showcases your talent for capturing the beauty of nature</p>

          <br>
      <p>This stunning piece of art took a significant amount of time to create, but it was well worth the effort. The realistic reflection of the candle wax and the blurred background add to its overall magic. The combination of black and red is the perfect representation of the struggle between light and darkness</p>

        <div class="slide"><div class="aroundimg"><img src="/images/pink.jpg" alt="sunset"></div>
          <br>
      <p>The sky in this painting is a beautiful shade of pink, reminiscent of a fairy tale. It inspires feelings of freedom and a desire to escape into a world of pureness and simplicity. The image depicts a world without the struggles and difficulties we face in our daily lives, reminding us to seek the easy path in life rather than the more challenging one.</p>

      <div class="slide"><div class="aroundimg"><img src="/images/night.jpg" alt="sunset"></div>
      <br>
  <p>This painting features an owl, an animal known for not sleeping at night. The owl was included during a time when the i was experiencing difficulty sleeping. The painting serves as a reminder that time passes and new days bring hope. In the meantime, we can admire the moon and stars on chilly nights and find solace in their beauty.</p>

  <div class="slide"><div class="aroundimg"><img src="/images/mountain.jpg" alt="sunset"></div>
  <br>
<p>I did not put any deliberate effort into this piece, instead allowing my child to express his creativity freely. This painting serves as a reminder that sometimes in life, we don't need to put in effort to create something beautiful. The perspective we have on life can change greatly depending on our viewpoint. For example, mountains may appear small from a distance but become larger as we approach them, while from the mountain's perspective, we may appear small but our lives are still full of meaning and purpose. </p>

<div class="slide"><div class="aroundimg"><img src="/images/boat.jpg" alt="sunset"></div>
<br>
<p>This painting is a classic scene featuring an ocean, boat, sunset, coconut trees, birds, and clouds. As a child, we have all likely drawn a similar picture, and the artist finally got the chance to bring this vision to life as an adult. The inclusion of the boat and the birds add a touch of life to the serene scene, while the clouds add a playful element to the beautiful sunset.</p>

<div class="slide"><div class="aroundimg"><img src="/images/last.jpg" alt="sunset"></div>
<br>
<p>This painting depicts a chilly day by a riverbank. The sound of water flowing and colliding with stones creates a peaceful atmosphere, while iam sitting on a stone with my legs in the water. The water is soft and cold, and the overall scene invokes a feeling of calmness and serenity. I  want to stay in this moment, surrounded by the sounds of nature, for an infinite amount of time, lost in thought and free from worries.
